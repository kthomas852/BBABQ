    <h3>Rules of the road:<br>
    	Always wear a helmet<br>
        Before riding out of a driveway into the street, stop. Look left, then right, and then left again for traffic<br>
        Ride on the right side of the street, with the flow of traffic<br>
	    Stop at all stop signs and look left, right, and left again for traffic<br>
		Use reflectors and bicycle lights as they are required for night riding<br>
    	<br>
    	Best Riding Practices:<br>
    	Remember when riding that you are considered a vehicle by law.  Stay off the sidewalk.  Drivers<br>
    	are less likely to see you on the sidewalk and will be running you over before they ever realize<br>
    	you are there.  As a cyclist you are most visible in the middle of the far right lane or in a <br>
    	designated bicycle lane.  Look drivers in the eye when approaching a turning car and never be<br>
    	afraid to give them a "friendly" wave.  This will help them see you and help brighten their day<br>
    	and yours.  When <br>
